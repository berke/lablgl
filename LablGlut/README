INTRODUCTION
The lablglut library is an OCaml binding for GLUT version 3.7.  GLUT 
(GL Utility Toolkit) is a portable windowing library for OpenGL, 
written by Mark Kilgard.  GLUT tends to be easier to install and use than
other OpenGL windowing alternatives.  It is very portable, depending
only on libraries for OpenGL and the underlying window system.  

The names "lablglut" and 'lablGL' come from the variable labeling they use.

INSTALLATION

  The easy way is to become root and say:

    ./build all opt install clean test

  Otherwise it's necessary to modify installation targets in the 
  Makefiles.  

LICENSE 
Both lablglut and lablGL are under BSD-style licenses.
