- Go ahead and do this the right way, with a proper hand-made lexer.
  genlex is going to get confused by things like 
    a&*b 
  where the the operators are mushed together.  Genlex will probably think it's
  all one keyword or just freak out and give an error.  

- Change the comments to a form that genlex won't strip away. 
  We want to keep the comments.  They help understand the demos.
