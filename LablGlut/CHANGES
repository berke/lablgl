==== 1.1.4 ====

* added glutReportErrors
* added video resize sub-api
* ported tests 18, 21, 17

-- Aug 10 --

  OCaml's type system
* ported menu_test, shape_test, tests 14, 20, 8
(archived)
* fixed bug with createSubWindow not returning a value in wrap_glut.c

==== 1.1.2 ====

-- Aug 6 2002 --

* fixed a problem with specialUpFunc
* cleaned up the specialFunc code
* wrapped all GLUT version 4 functions from the GLUT 3.7 distribution
* changed bitmap character routines to use ints instead of strings when
  passing to the C layer.  should be much faster.

* fixed a bug in the handling of modifiers
* fixed a bug with attachMenu and detachMenu
* ported tests 7, 11, 19, timer_test, 27,

* added all remaining functions from GLUT 3.7

* ported GLUT tests 1 through 5

==== 1.0.1 ====

* added bundled version of LablGL 0.96 with Tcl/Tk dependency removed
* converted some more demos from Tk-style to GLUT-style
