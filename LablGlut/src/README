Introduction
============
LablGLUT is an OCaml binding for Mark Kilgard's simple OpenGL windowing
library GLUT (GL Utility Toolkit).  It comes with a simple set of GL and
GLU bindings constructed with a slightly modified version of Xavier Leroy's
wrapper generating tool Camlidl.  Also included is a program called c2ml,
based on Hugues Casse's FrontC library and Rewrite program.  c2ml partially 
converts GLUT demos written in C to OCaml with the LablGLUT bindings, though 
some additional modification is usually necessary to get them to work.

The GL and GLU bindings are intended to supplement, but not replace the 
LablGL binding by Jacques Garrigue.

*1 Requires knowledge of polymorphic variants, labeled function arguments, and
   optional function arguments. 
*2 camlgl's glut wrapper doesn't appear to support multiple windows.

Installation and use
====================
    ./config.sh
    make
    make install
    cd ../progs/redbook
    for i in *.ml; do echo $i; lablglut $i; done

Todo
====
- Translate lots of GLUT demos
- Add support for NVidia's Cg
- Add findlib support
- Fix up the parts of the build system that are broken.
